# Meme Generator Scrimba

This project is about creating a meme generator following Scrimba's Learn React course. Users will be able to access a range of memes from a memes database. This is done by clicking on the button which will cause a new meme image to show underneath. This website uses React, HTML5, CSS3 and other technologies.
